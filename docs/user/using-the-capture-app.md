# Using the Capture app { #capture_app } 

## About the Capture app { #about_capture_app } 

In the Capture app you register events that occurred at a particular time and place. An event can happen at any given point in time. This stands in contrast to routine data, which is captured for predefined, regular intervals. Events are sometimes called cases or records. In DHIS2, events are linked to a program. The Capture app lets you select the organisation unit and program and specify a date when an event happened, before entering information for the event. Some events are linked to a tracked entity instance, for example a person, allowing longitudinal follow-up.

## Register an event { #capture_register_event } 

1. Open the **Capture** app.

2. Select an organisation unit.

3. Select an event program.

    You will only see programs associated with the selected organisation unit and programs you have access to, and that are shared with your user group through data level sharing.

4. If the program has a category combination set the category option will have to be selected.

5. Click **Create new event**.

    ![create new event](resources/images/create_new_event.png)

6. Fill in the required information. If the programs program stage is configured to capture a location:

    - If the field is a coordinate field you can either enter the coordinates
    directly or you can click the **map** icon to the left of the coordinate field.
    The latter one will open a map where you can search for a location or set on
    directly by clicking on the map.

    - If the field is a polygon field you can click the **map** icon to the left of
    the field. This will open a map where you can search for a location and capture
    a polygon (button in the upper right corner of the map).

7. If desired you can add a comment by clicking the **Write comment** button at the bottom of the form. Note that Event comments are attributed to a user and cannot be deleted. 

8. If desired you can add a relationship by clicking the **Add relationship** button at the bottom of the form.
   See the section about **Adding a relationship** for more information.

9. Click **Save and exit** or click the arrow next to the button to select **Save and add another**.

    - **Save and add another** will save the current event and clear the form.
    All the events that you have captured will be displayed in a list at the bottom of the page.
    When you want to finish capturing events you can, if the form is blank,
    click the finish button or if your form contains data click the arrow
    next to **Save and add another** and select **Save and exit**.

> **Note**

## Register a tracked entity instance

There are two different ways one can register a tracked entity instance under an organisation unit.
The first way, is to register a tracked entity instance without enrolling it to a tracker program.
The second option, is to register a tracked entity instance with program and enroll it. 

### Without a program enrollment 

1. Open the **Capture** app.

2. Select an organisation unit.

3. Click **Create new**.

    ![image](resources/images/register-without-enrollment-new-button.png)

    You'll now be navigated to the registration page. In that page you will see a drop down 
    menu similar to the one in the image below. From the dropdown menu you can select a tracked entity 
    type, eg. Building, Person etc.
    
    ![image](resources/images/register-without-enrollment-dropdown-menu.png)

4. Select the tracked entity type which you want to create a new instance for.
 
    ![image](resources/images/register-without-enrollment-dropdown-menu-with-arrow.png)
    
5. The moment you select a tracked entity type, a form will be shown on the screen. 
    
    The "Profile" section will be shown. In this section you can add data relevant to the 
    tracked entity instance. The profile section mainly contains all the tracked entity attributes
    linked to the tracked entity type. 

    ![image](resources/images/register-without-enrollment-form.png)

6. Fill in the required information.

    If the tracked entity type is configured to capture a location:

    - If the field is a coordinate field you can either enter the coordinates
    directly or you can click the **map** icon to the left of the coordinate field.
    The latter one will open a map where you can search for a location or set on
    directly by clicking on the map.

    - If the field is a polygon field you can click the **map** icon to the left of
    the field. This will open a map where you can search for a location and capture
    a polygon (button in the upper right corner of the map).

7. Click the **Save person** button to register the tracked entity instance. 
    
8. You will now be prompted to the tracked entity instance dashboard. 

    The dashboard will show relevant information about the newly created tracked entity instance.

### With a program enrollment

1. Open the **Capture** app.

2. Select an organisation unit.

3. Select a tracker program of your choice.

4. Click **Create new person**. Please note that the label of this button corresponds to the tracked entity type of the program, which could vary, such as "Building," "Person," etc.

    ![create new event](resources/images/register-and-enroll-program-selection.png)
 
5. Now, you will be able to see a form similar to the image below. 

    The enrollment form has different layouts depending on how the program is customized. The top section has the title "Enrollment",
    and it holds all the relevant information about the enrollment details. This section will always be present, regardless of layout.
    Underneath, the different data input fields relevant to the tracked entity instance will be displayed. 
    These fields will either be displayed within sections or as a completely custom form. 
    The sections, or custom form, mainly contains all the tracked entity attributes linked to the program or tracked entity type.

      ![create new event](resources/images/register-and-enroll-form.png)

6. Fill in the required information for the enrollment.
    If the tracked entity type is configured to capture a location:

    - If the field is a coordinate field you can either enter the coordinates
    directly or you can click the **map** icon to the left of the coordinate field.
    The latter one will open a map where you can search for a location or set on
    directly by clicking on the map.

    - If the field is a polygon field you can click the **map** icon to the left of
    the field. This will open a map where you can search for a location and capture
    a polygon (button in the upper right corner of the map).

7. Click **Save person** to register the tracked entity instance. 
    The **Save** button shows a loading spinner and the **Cancel** button is disabled while the request is processing.
    
8. You will now be prompted to the tracked entity instance dashboard. 

    The dashboard will show relevant information about the newly created tracked entity instance.

### Enrollment with auto generated events 

Events can automatically be created when enrolling in a program.

To automatically generate events, you can do the necessary configuration in the maintenance app.
1. Open the maintenance app

2. Select the Program tab
![](resources/images/auto-generated-01.png)

3. Select a Tracker program
![](resources/images/auto-generated-02.png)

4. Select the Program stages tab
![](resources/images/auto-generated-03.png)

5. Click on the program stage you would like to generate an event for
![](resources/images/auto-generated-04.png)

6. Select "Auto-generate event"
![](resources/images/auto-generated-05.png)

You can set multiple program stages within a program to be auto-generating (this will create an event for each program stage configured this way)

### Enrollment with open data entry form

A program can be configured to automatically take the user to register a new event immediately after enrolling a tracked entity instance. To enable this behavior, the program must have at least one program stage with the "Open data entry form after registration" option checked. If more than one program stage has this option enabled, the first stage will be used.

To configure it, you must follow the steps described in the [Enrollment with auto generated events](#enrollment-with-auto-generated-events) section and then check the option "Open data entry form after enrollment".

### Enrollment with first stage on registration page

For tracker programs enable the "First stage appears on registration page" flag in the Maintenance. The enrollment registration page will now display the first program stage the user has access to.

![](resources/images/first-stage-during-registration.png)

#### Active type of event

If the stage has the "Open data entry form after enrollment" selected, then the event will be generated into the ACTIVE status. Also its execution date will be calculated for the event, in addition to a due date.
The generation happens based on either the enrollment date or the incident date. You can choose the reporting date from the dropdown menu "Report date to use".
![](resources/images/auto-generated-06.png)

As shown in the image you have three options, a) Incident date b) Enrollment date or c) No value. 
Choosing reporting date as "Incident date" indicates that both the event execution date and due date will be the same as the incident date.
Choosing reporting date as either "Enrollment date" or "No value" indicates that both the event execution date and due date will be the same as the enrollment date.

#### Schedule type of event

When the "Open data entry after enrollment" is not checked, it means that the event generated will be a SCHEDULE event. 
The scheduled event does not have an execution date, but only a due date. The due date for these future events are calculated based on either enrollment date or incident date. If the flag below is checked, the reference date is the enrollment date, if the flag is not checked, the incident date is used.
![](resources/images/auto-generated-07.png)

When there is no incident date, the reference date will fall back on the enrollment date regardless of whether the flag above is checked.

On SCHEDULE type of events the user can also configure the "Scheduled days from start". Which means if a stage has a number in "Scheduled days from start" the reference date will increased by that number. 
In the example below we increase the due date by 30 days.

![](resources/images/auto-generated-08.png)

When the "Scheduled days from start" does not contain a number or contains 0 the reference date is used without adding any days to it.


### Possible duplicates detection

In both cases of registering a tracked entity instance, (with enrollment or without enrollment) the system will start looking for possible duplicates.
Note that, programs need to be correctly configured through the maintenance app for the system to start detecting duplicates when enrolling a new person in a program. 

To configure a program through the maintenance app you will have to: 


1. Open the maintenance app.
![](resources/images/duplicates-maintenance-config-00.png)

2. In the program section select your program. We select Child Programme for this example.
![](resources/images/duplicates-maintenance-config-01.png)

3. Select the Attributes tab.
![](resources/images/duplicates-maintenance-config-02.png)

4. Enable duplicates search by checking program attributes as searchable
![](resources/images/duplicates-maintenance-config-03.png)


The attributes you have selected as "Searchable" will be the ones which the system will use to detect possible duplicates against.  
Let us explain this with an example that demonstrates the detection of possible duplicates while enrolling a child in the Child Programme. 

1. Open the **Capture** app.
![](resources/images/duplicates-on-creation-00.png)

2. Select your organisation unit and program from the menu on the top.
![](resources/images/duplicates-on-creation-01.png)

3. Click **Create new person**
![](resources/images/duplicates-on-creation-02.png)

4. Fill in the first name in the form. **Remember, the first name we have checked as "Searchable" in the maintenance app.** 
Click **Save person**. The system will start looking for possible duplicates that match the name Sarah.
![](resources/images/duplicates-on-creation-03.png)

5. The system will automatically show a list of possible duplicates if there are any. 
![](resources/images/duplicates-on-creation-04.png)

6. You can choose to make a new enrollement by clicking **Save as new** or if you see the right person in the list - you can view the dashboard.
![](resources/images/duplicates-on-creation-05.png)

> **Tip**
>
> You can configure duplicates detection for tracked entity types the same way as we did for programs. 


### Program rules execution

In both cases of registering a tracked entity instance, (with enrollment or without enrollment) the system will run program rules you have configured.
Note that, rules can be configured in the maintenance app.

To see a rule being executed while enrolling a tracked entity instance you will have to take the following steps. 

1. Configure a rule in the maintenance app. For the example below we configured a rule that throws a warning when the date of birth is less than a year.

2. Open the **Capture** app.
![](resources/images/duplicates-on-creation-00.png)

3. Select your organisation unit and program from the menu on the top.
![](resources/images/program-rules-on-creation-00.png)

4. Fill in the date of birth with a value which is less than a year. In our case this is 27th of January 2021. 
![](resources/images/program-rules-on-creation-01.png)

5. You will now be able to see the warning produced by the program rule underneath the birth date field. 
![](resources/images/program-rules-on-creation-02.png)

## Re-enroll an existing tracked entity instance

When you are on the re-enroll page, the teId will be visible in the URL parameters. The attributes of the tracked entity instance will be pre-fielded with the current values. 
![](resources/images/enroll-existing-tei.png)


## Adding a relationship { #capture_add_relationship } 

Relationships can be added either during registration, editing or viewing of an event.
Currently the **Capture App** only supports *Event to Tracked Entity Instance* relationships.

1. While in an event, click **Add relationship**.

2. Select the relationship type you want to create.

You now have two options: 

- **Link to an existing Tracked Entity Instance** or 

- **Create new Tracked Entity Instance**.

![relationship options](resources/images/relationship_options.png)

### Link to an existing Tracked Entity Instance

1. Click **Link to an existing Tracked Entity Instance**.

- You will be presented with some options for searching for a **Tracked Entity Instance**.
  You have the option to select a **program**. If a **program** is selected the attributes are derived from the selected **program**.
  If no **program** is selected, only the attributes that belong to the **Tracked Entity Instance** will be visible.

    ![search for Tracked Entity Instance](resources/images/search_tei.png)

    - If the **Tracked Entity Instance** or **program** is configured with a unique attribute, this attribute can be
      used for finding a specific **Tracked Entity Instance** or **program**. This attribute should be presented alone.
      When the unique attribute field has been filled out, click the **Search** button located right below
      the unique attribute field.

    - If the **Tracked Entity Instance** or **program** has attibutes these can be used for searching by expanding the **Search by attributes** box.
      When all desired attribute fields have been filled out, click the **Search by attributes** button located at the bottom. You can also limit the search by setting the **Organisation unit scope**. If set to *All accessible* you will search for the **Tracked Entity Instance** in all organisation units you have access to. If you select *Selected*, you will be asked to select which organisation units to search within.

2. After a successful search you will be presented with a list of **Tracked Entity Instances** matching the search criteria.
   To create a relationship click the **Link** button on the **Tracked Entity Instance** you would like to create a relationship to.

- If you did not find the **Tracked Entity Instance** you were looking for, you can either click the **New search** or **Edit search** buttons.
  **New search** will take you to new blank search while **Edit search** will take you back to the search you just performed keeping the search criteria.

### Create new Tracked Entity Instance

1. Click **Create new Tracked Entity Instance**.

- You are now presented with a form for registering a new **Tracked Entity Instance**. You can choose to either register with or without a program.
  If a program is selected, the new **Tracked Entity Instance** will be enrolled in said program. You can also change the **Organisation unit** by removing the one that is automatically set and selecting a new one.

  ![register new Tracked Entity Instance](resources/images/register_tei.png)

2. Fill in the desired (and possibly mandatory) attributes and enrollment details.

3. Click **Create Tracked Entity Instance and Link**.

> **Note**
>
> When filling in data you might face a warning telling you that a possible duplicate has been found. You can click the warning to see these
> duplicates and if the duplicate is a match you can choose to link that **Tracked Entity Instance** by clicking the **Link** button.
> If the warning is still present when you are done filling in data, you will not see the **Create Tracked Entity Instance and Link** button.
> Instead you will be presented with a button called **Review duplicates**. When you click this button a list of possible duplicates will be displayed.
> If any of these duplicates matches the **Tracked Entity Instance** you are trying to create you can click the **Link** button, if not you can click
> the **Save as new person** button to register a new **Tracked Entity Instance**.

![](resources/images/tracker_program.png)


## Search for tracked entity instances

### In Program scope

1. Open the **Capture** app.

2. Select a program.

    You will only see programs associated with the selected organisation unit and programs you have access to, and that are shared with your user group through data level sharing.

3. Click the Search button.

4. From the dropdown menu click the first option.

    ![](resources/images/search-by-attributes-find-button.png)

    These steps will take you to the search page. There, based on the configuration of your organisation, will see the different attributes you can search with. An example of how this looks is the following.

    ![](resources/images/search-by-attributes-on-scope-program-overview-0.png)

    To execute a search now:

1. Fill in the attributes you want to search with.

2. Click the **Search by attributes** button.

    ![](resources/images/search-by-attributes-on-scope-program-overview-1.png)

3. The results of the search will be displayed as follows.

    ![](resources/images/search-by-attributes-on-scope-program-overview-2.png)

    In this list you can see the entries that match your search. For each entry you can have a total of three options.

    a. You can choose to view the dashboard for the **Tracked Entity Instance** by clicking the "View dashboard" button

    ![](resources/images/search-by-attributes-on-scope-program-overview-4.png)


#### Fallback search

Execute a full search as described above. If the search you have made has results they will be displayed. However, the actual **Tracked Entity Instance** you are searching for may be within a different program. In that case, you may want to extend the search to other programs. This is known as a fallback search.

To execute a fallback search, simply press the button on the bottom saying "Search in all programs".
You will see the **Results in all programs** be appended below the search in the current program. These two modules are collapsible to save space. 

If the fallback can not be done, you will be presented with a modal to go **Back to search** so that you can change the search terms.

> **Note**
>
> The fallback search is only possible when searching within a Program.

![](resources/images/search-by-attributes-fallback-overview-0.png)

## Implementer / administrator info { #implementer_info } 

### Metadata caching { #metadata_caching } 

For performance reasons the Capture app caches metadata in the client browser. When metadata is updated on the server the changes needs to be propagated to the clients that have already cached the metadata. Depending on the change, this is done in one of three ways:

1. If the change is bound to a program you will need to increase the program version for that particular program. For example, if you change the data elements in a program or a program rule, the version for the bound program needs be increased.

2. If the change is NOT bound to a program you will need to increase ANY program version for the change to be propagated to the clients. Examples here are changes to constants, organisation unit levels or organisation unit groups.

3. The exception to the two rules above is option sets. Option sets have their own version property, i.e. increasing the option set version should ensure the option set metadata are propagated to the clients.


## Enrollment dashboard

### Enabling the enrollment dashboard

#### Opt in

Enable the enrollment dashboard for a Tracker program for all the users. The dialog is visible for users with program write access. 

![](resources/images/enrollment-dash-opt-in.png)

#### Opt out

Disable the enrollment dashboard for a Tracker program for all the users.

![](resources/images/enrollment-dash-opt-out.png)

### Reaching the enrollment dashboard via url

You reach the enrollment dashboard either by typing in the address bar of your browser or using the user interface of the capture app.
In this section we are focusing on the first use-case, where you type or paste the url you want to access in the Address bar.

![](resources/images/enrollment-dash-01.png)

One way to reach the enrollment dashboard and view a specific tracked entity instance's enrollment is by using _only_ the enrollment id. For example the link .../dhis-web-capture/#/enrollment?enrollmentId=wBU0RAsYjKE will 
take you the dashboard for the enrollment with id `wBU0RAsYjKE`. 

The top of the dashboard defines your context. For example in the image below the context is as follows, the selected program is "Child Programme", the organisation unit is "Ngelehun CHC", the selected person is "Anna Jones" and the selected enrollment is "2017-11-16 11:38".

![](resources/images/enrollment-dash-02.png)

You can change your context by clicking the "x" button.

![](resources/images/enrollment-dash-03.png)

#### Deselecting the program

When you deselect the program you see the following

![](resources/images/enrollment-dash-05.png)

If the tracked entity instance (in this case "Anna Jones") has enrollments under the program you select you will see the following message.

![](resources/images/enrollment-dash-09.png)

##### Selecting a program with zero enrollments

If the tracked entity instance (in this case "Anna Jenkins") does not have enrollments under the program you select you will see a message explaining that there are no enrollments for that program.
You will also be given the option to enroll "Anna Jenkins" in that program.

![](resources/images/enrollment-dash-10.png)

##### Selecting an event program 

When you select an event program you will see the following. (Remember event programs do not have enrollments in the system, only tracker programs do).

![](resources/images/enrollment-dash-11.png)

You will also be given the option to either create a new event for the selected program or view the working lists for the selected program.

##### Selecting a program with a different tracked entity type 

When your selected tracked entity type is a person, as in our example with Anna Jenkins, and you select a program that is not of type person but for example of a type Malaria case you will see the following.

![](resources/images/enrollment-dash-12.png)

You are also given the option to enroll a tracked entity instance in the program you selected.

#### Deselecting the organisation unit

When you deselect the organisation unit you see the following

![](resources/images/enrollment-dash-06.png)

![](resources/images/user_assignment_report_new.png)

![](resources/images/user_assignment_schedule_new_filled.png)

### Schedule event widget form
Instead of reporting an event the user can select to schedule an event for later. The form will open with a suggested scheduled date. This date is determined by a set of rules as explained below.

The suggested date for the first event of a program stage in an enrollment is always based on the enrollment date or the incident date (depending on the program configuration). The program stage configuration setting "scheduled days from start" will be added to the base date to cumpute the suggested date.

#### 1. **Default next scheduled date**
If a program stage has a default next scheduled date configured, the suggested date is the most recent next scheduled date. Below is an example of how this can work.
>
1. A data element with value type date needs to be created and assigned to the particular program stage with access to future dates. The name of the data element could for example be: Next suggested follow up date. The program stage is configured to use the data element as default when scheduling a new event by assigning the data element to default next scheduled date.

![](resources/images/schedule_event_01.png)

2. A program rule based on the data entered in the program stage, will determine how many days until the next suggested follow up will be. For example: A program rule with the following condition: #{penta_dose} == '1' (The program rule will trigger when the TEI has received Penta Dose 1), Assign value to the data element: next suggested follow up date with expression: d2:addDays(V{event_date}, '30') **The number suggest how many days from event date the next scheduled event should be.** 

3. Open the Capture app and create a TEI. As long as Penta Dose has value Dose 1, the suggested next scheduled event is 30 days forward from event date. When scheduling a new event, the system will pick up from the data element as long it has value.

![](resources/images/schedule_event_02.png)

![](resources/images/schedule_event_03.png)

![](resources/images/schedule_event_04.png)

User can also find more information about how many events that scheduled on the same selected date or the interval of selected date and the suggested date from the information box.

Below the schedule date entry, user can choose to add a comment to the scheduled event.

After clicking **Schedule** button, user will be navigated back to enrollment overview page.

#### 2. **Standard interval days** 

1. If the program stage has standard interval days configured, the suggested date is calculated by the most recent event date plus the standard interval days value. 

![](resources/images/standard_interval_days_01.png)

2. If the program stage do not have a default next scheduled date configured, the system will use the standard interval days to calculate the next scheduled event date. 

![](resources/images/standard_interval_days_02.png)


#### 3. **If no value is found on either, the suggested date will be defined by enrollment date and incident date.** 

1. In case the option **Generate events based on enrollment date** is checked in the Maintenance app, the next suggested event date is calculated by the enrollment date plus the value of scheduled days from start. 

![](resources/images/schedule_event_from_enrollmentdate_01.png)

2. In case the option **Show incident date** is checked, the next suggested event date is calculated by the incident date plus the value of scheduled days from start.

![](resources/images/schedule_event_from_incidentdate_01.png)

## Program stage event list 

You can reach the program stage event list by clicking **Go to full {stage event name}** button in the overview page.
