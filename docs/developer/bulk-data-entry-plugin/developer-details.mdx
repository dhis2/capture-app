Here are some details for developers who want to develop a bulk data entry plugin for the DHIS2 Capture app.

## Plugin Interface

The plugin receives the following props:

```ts
type BulkDataEntryPluginProps = {|
    pluginSource: string,    
    configKey: string,  
    dataKey?: string,        
    onClose: () => Promise<void>, 
    trackedEntities?: Array<string>,
|};
```

### Closing the Plugin

To properly close the plugin and clean up resources, use the `onClose` function provided as a prop. This function will remove the selected configuration from IndexedDB.

```ts
onClose();
```
