Here are some details for developers who want to develop a bulk data entry plugin for the DHIS2 Capture app.

## Plugin Interface

The plugin receives the following props:

```ts
type BulkDataEntryPluginProps = {|
    pluginSource: string,    
    configKey: string,  
    dataKey?: string,        
    onComplete: () => Promise<void>,
    onDefer: () => void,
    trackedEntityIds?: Array<string>,
|};
```

### Exiting the Plugin

To exit the Plugin and return to the Program overview or Search pages, use the `onDefer` function provided as a prop. This will place the Plugin in an idle state until further action is taken.

```ts
onDefer();
```

### Closing the Plugin

To ensure proper cleanup and resource management, use the `onComplete` function provided as a prop to close the plugin. This will clear the selected configuration from `IndexedDB`.
```ts
onComplete();
```
