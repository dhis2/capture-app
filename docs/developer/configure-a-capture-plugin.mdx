# Configuration

---

One of the developers in the DHIS2 Core development team has created an application that allows you to configure a Capture plugin in the DHIS2 Capture app.

This application is called __Tracker Plugin Configurator__ and is available in the [DHIS2 App Hub](https://apps.dhis2.org/app/85d156b7-6e3f-43f0-be57-395449393f7d).

The app is also installable from the App Management app in your DHIS2 instance.
