/* Custom withTheme HOC that replicates part of Material-UI’s withTheme logic.
This implementation takes a pragmatic approach, with the goal of removing Material-UI and migrating to Emotion as smoothly as possible.
Emotion provides a useTheme hook, but its withTheme is used as withTheme(Component), whereas Material-UI’s version is invoked as withTheme()(Component).
