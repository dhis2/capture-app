/* 
    Using container queries doesn't work in our material ui withStyles. 
    Media queries could have been used instead, but they are very hard to maintain so I'm opting
    to use container queryies in css directly.
    Info about container queries here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_containment/Container_queries
